# Logistic-Regression

ABSTRACT : Subjects receiving the same vaccine often show different levels of immune responses and some may even present adverse side effects to the vaccine. Systems vaccinology can combine data and machine learning techniques to obtain highly predictive signatures of vaccine immunogenicity and reactogenicity. Currently, several machine learning methods are already available to researchers with no background in bioinformatics.


PROBLEM STATEMENT : Predict how likely it is that the people will take an H1N1 flu vaccine using Logistic Regression.


APPROACH: To predict whether individuals are likely to take a vaccine based on demographic, health, and behavioral factors.


Tools & Libraries: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn


Key Steps:
	•	Conducted data cleaning and preprocessing including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
	•	Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns affecting vaccine uptake.
	•	Built a Logistic Regression model to classify individuals into vaccine users and non-users.
	•	Evaluated model performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and ROC-AUC score.
	•	Visualized model insights to understand feature importance and decision boundaries.

 
Outcome: Developed a reliable classifier that can aid in targeting vaccination campaigns more effectively by identifying high-probability vaccine adopters.
